# Crohn's Companion App Implementation Plan

## 1. Implementation Context

### Feature Summary
Crohn's Companion is a comprehensive health tracking application designed specifically for individuals with Crohn's disease. The app enables users to track symptoms, diet, bowel movements, medications/supplements, and receive AI-powered insights to help manage their condition more effectively.

### User Workflow Overview
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and sign in with email, Google, or Apple ID
- **Daily Tracking**: Log daily symptoms, bowel movements, pain levels, and energy levels
- **Symptom Management**: Track and monitor Crohn's-specific symptoms over time
- **Diet Tracking**: Record meals and identify food triggers and safe foods
- **Supplement Tracking**: Manage supplement intake and schedules
- **Insights**: Receive AI-generated insights based on tracked data
- **Chat Assistant**: Interact with an AI assistant for personalized advice

### Technical Context
The application will be built using Flutter for cross-platform (iOS and Android) compatibility, with Supabase as the backend service. The existing Flutter backend provides modular services that will be integrated with the new UI based on the HTML mockups.

### Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Integration with Supabase Auth for user management
- **Data Storage**: Supabase database for storing user tracking data
- **AI Services**: Integration with Supabase Edge Functions for insights and chat functionality
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for reminders and insights

### Success Criteria
- Fully functional Flutter app that implements all features shown in the HTML mockups
- Seamless integration with the existing backend services
- Smooth user experience across iOS and Android platforms
- Proper data synchronization between app and backend

### Architecture Diagram
The application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

```
UI Layer (Flutter Widgets)
    ↓
BLoC/Provider (State Management)
    ↓
Repository Layer
    ↓
Backend Services (Supabase Client)
    ↓
Supabase Backend (Auth, Database, Storage, Edge Functions)
```

### Technical Approach
1. Set up a new Flutter project with the required dependencies
2. Integrate the existing backend services
3. Implement the UI components based on the HTML mockups
4. Connect the UI with the backend services
5. Implement state management using BLoC or Provider pattern
6. Add platform-specific configurations for iOS and Android

### Dependencies
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Supabase Flutter SDK
- Existing backend services from the FlutterBackend directory
- Additional Flutter packages for UI components, state management, etc.
